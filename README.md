Micemade is a one person company creating code for WordPress since 2009.
From the introduction of custom meta, custom post types and taxonomies to the AI in WordPress, I am here.

What my mice built:
* custom WP sites built for small/medium businesses,
* local hospitality industry directory,
* Premium WP/WOO themes (sold on Theme Forest/Envato)
* Building and maintaining local Woo shop 15+ years (until 2023) [HADDAD.HR](https://haddad.hr)
* Creating WordPress block themes and block plugins
