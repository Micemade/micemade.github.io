"Micemade" is a one person company creating code for WordPress since 2009.
From the introduction of custom meta, custom post types and taxonomies, to the AI in WordPress, I am here.

## What have I worked on over the years:**
* custom WP sites built for small/medium businesses,
* local hospitality industry directory,
* Premium WP/WOO themes (sold on Theme Forest/Envato)
* Building and maintaining local Woo shop 15+ years (until 2023) [HADDAD.HR](https://haddad.hr)
* Customizations of WooCommerce shops
* Creating WordPress block themes and block plugins

## WordPress Plugins (Free)

I've created a number of WordPres plugins and themes, some are still alive, some of which are hosted on WordPress.org, some on GitHub, and there are some that the time has removed from the usefulness.

- WordPress.org:
[WCSpots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wcspots)
[Blockette](https://wordpress.org/themes/blockette/)

- Github:
[Micemade Elements](https://github.com/Micemade/micemade-elements)
[WooCommerce Local Pickup Plus](https://github.com/Micemade/woocommerce-local-pickup-plus/)

## WordPress / WoocCommerce plugins (Premium)
